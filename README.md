# Try Out Development Containers: Java

[![Open in Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Dev%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-try-java)

A **development container** is a running container with a well-defined tool/runtime stack and its prerequisites. You can try out development containers with **[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)** or **[Visual Studio Code Dev Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers)**.

This is a sample project that lets you try out either option in a few easy steps. We have a variety of other [vscode-remote-try-*](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Amicrosoft+vscode-remote-try-&type=Repositories) sample projects, too.

> **Note:** If you already have a Codespace or dev container, you can jump to the [Things to try](#things-to-try) section.

## Setting up the development container

### GitHub Codespaces
Follow these steps to open this sample in a Codespace:
1. Click the **Code** drop-down menu.
2. Click on the **Codespaces** tab.
3. Click **Create codespace on main**.

For more info, check out the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/creating-a-codespace#creating-a-codespace).

### VS Code Dev Containers

Follow these steps to open this sample in a container using the VS Code Dev Containers extension:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please ensure your system meets the pre-reqs (i.e. have Docker installed) in the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started).

2. To use this repository, open a locally cloned copy of the code:

   - Clone this repository to your local filesystem.
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container...** command.
   - Select the cloned copy of this folder, wait for the container to start, and try things out!

## Things to try

Once you have this sample opened, you'll be able to work with it like you would locally.

Some things to try:

1. **Edit:**
   - Open `src/main/java/com/mycompany/app/App.java`.
   - Try adding some code and check out the language features.
   - Make a spelling mistake and notice it is detected. The [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) extension was automatically installed because it is referenced in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.
   - Also notice that the [Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack) is installed. The JDK is in the `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/java` image and Dev Container settings and metadata are automatically picked up from [image labels](https://containers.dev/implementors/reference/#labels).

2. **Terminal:** Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> and type `uname` and other Linux commands from the terminal window.

3. **Build, Run, and Debug:**
   - Open `src/main/java/com/mycompany/app/App.java`.
   - Add a breakpoint.
   - Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to launch the app in the container.
   - Once the breakpoint is hit, try hovering over variables, examining locals, and more.

4. **Run a Test:**
   - Open `src/test/java/com/mycompany/app/AppTest.java`.
   - Put a breakpoint in a test.
   - Click the `Debug Test` in the Code Lens above the function and watch it hit the breakpoint.

5. **Install Node.js using a Dev Container Feature:**
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Dev Containers: Configure Container Features...** or **Codespaces: Configure Container Features...** command.
   - Type "node" in the text box at the top.
   - Check the check box next to "Node.js (via nvm) and yarn" (published by devcontainers) 
   - Click OK
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Dev Containers: Rebuild Container** or **Codespaces: Rebuild Container** command so the modifications are picked up.
